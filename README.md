# ExercisePoseCorrection
This project implements a real-time fitness tracking and posture correction system using computer vision and deep learning techniques. It focuses on detecting and classifying three key exercises‚Äîpush-ups, squats, and bicep curls‚Äîwhile providing real-time feedback on exercise form.
üöÄ Features:
  ‚Ä¢Exercise Classification: Utilizes YOLOv8 for classifying push-ups, squats, and bicep curls.
  ‚Ä¢Pose Estimation: Leverages MediaPipe Pose to track skeletal landmarks and analyze exercise form.
  ‚Ä¢Real-Time Feedback: Offers immediate suggestions and corrections to improve workout posture and reduce the risk of injuries.
  ‚Ä¢Multi-Input Support:
        ‚Ä¢Webcam Integration
        ‚Ä¢DroidCam USB for smartphone usage
        ‚Ä¢Pre-recorded video uploads
  ‚Ä¢User-Friendly Deployment: Built using Streamlit for an interactive and intuitive interface.

üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
1. Data Collection
    ‚Ä¢Videos of exercises recorded at 60 FPS.
    ‚Ä¢Frames extracted and annotated using Roboflow.
    ‚Ä¢Data augmentation for diversity (brightness, rotation, flipping).
    ‚Ä¢Dataset split into:
        ‚Ä¢Training Set (70%)
        ‚Ä¢Validation Set (20%)
        ‚Ä¢Test Set (10%)

2. Model Training
    ‚Ä¢Trained using YOLOv8 architecture for robust and fast exercise detection.
    ‚Ä¢Optimized on GPU for efficiency.
    ‚Ä¢Metrics:
        ‚Ä¢Precision: 99%
        ‚Ä¢Recall: 89%
        ‚Ä¢mAP50-95: 92.7%

3. Pose Estimation & Form Analysis
    ‚Ä¢MediaPipe Pose identifies body landmarks.
    ‚Ä¢Specific posture criteria ensure correct exercise execution:
        ‚Ä¢Push-Ups: Detect up/down phases and evaluate back alignment.
        ‚Ä¢Squats: Analyze knee alignment, shoulder-to-knee posture, and back angle.
        ‚Ä¢Bicep Curls: Assess elbow movement and shoulder stability.

4. Deployment
    ‚Ä¢Streamlit app allows real-time feedback and video analysis.
    ‚Ä¢Three modes of input:
        ‚Ä¢Webcam for live feedback.
        ‚Ä¢DroidCam USB to use a smartphone as a webcam.
        ‚Ä¢Video Uploads for offline analysis.

üìä Results

    ‚Ä¢High accuracy in detecting and classifying exercises.
    ‚Ä¢Comprehensive feedback on form:
        ‚Ä¢Real-time corrections using skeletal landmarks.
        ‚Ä¢Detailed metrics like joint angles and motion tracking.
    ‚Ä¢Loss curves and precision-recall graphs demonstrate strong model performance.
